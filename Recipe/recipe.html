        <p>From Wikipedia: Rendang (/r&#603;n&#712;d&#230;&#331;/; Indonesian pronunciation: [&#712;r&#601;nda&#331;]) is a Minangkabau dish. It is a rich meat dish that has been slow cooked and braised in a coconut milk and seasoned with a herb and spice mixture over a period of several hours until the liquids evaporate, and the meat turns dark brown and tender, becoming caramelized and infused with rich flavours.&sup1;</p>
        <p>This meal often pairs well with long grain rice. It is definitely one of my favorite foods due to how the textures of the meat blending in very well and how great the flavors are. Many regions of Indonesia often have their ways of creating rendang, but rendang will always involve meat (especially beef), coconut milk, and chili. The recipe listed is from another website since we often do not keep recipes in the kitchen. Credits to RecipeTin Eats for providing the webpage.&#178;</p>
